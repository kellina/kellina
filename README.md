### Hi there 👋

My name is Kellina Oliveira, and I'm from Brazil (🇧🇷). I’m currently learning Web Development. :)
I'm passionate about Front-end development, so I've created some projects as my portfolio (https://portfolio.kellina.com.br) and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my studies.
Some technologies that I have been working on small personal projects: javascript, html, css, postgres and react.

In my free time, I like to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺) and to read books (📚).


Would you like to find me?
